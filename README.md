What is this project all about?

Setup Instructions (git cg-init)
--------------------------------
=Approach A: Clone the Repo
First, you need the cg-init repo somewhere on your system. If you have a projects folder, just clone the repo down. That way, you can contribute back up! 
Then, add the full path to the cg-init/tools/ folder to your $PATH variable (in, for example, ~/.profile)

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/cg-init/tools/
```
